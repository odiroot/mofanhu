Start the complete stack in a standard way:

    $ docker-compose up --build --detach

Check the logs

    $ docker-compose logs --follow

### Manually

*Note*: Ensure you have a working Python 3.8 installation.

Create a virtualenv:

    $ virtualenv -p `which python3.8` .env

Install dependencies:

    $ source .env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -Ur requirements.txt

Prepare the environment (_direnv_ has to be preinstalled):

    $ cp envrc.example .envrc
    $ direnv edit

Run the development web server:

    $ flask run
